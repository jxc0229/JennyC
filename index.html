      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Jenny Chen, and I’m currently a senior studying computer science at Cornell University.
        I’ve been researching quantum computing and was a teaching assistant for our introductory algorithm class for
        two semesters. I’m trying to explore more areas in computer science, including machine learning, reinforcement
        learning, robotics, etc. Besides those technical interests, I also like game design, cooking, going to the gym,
        and reading. I’m a big fan of Ted Chiang, Stephen King, and Liu Cixin!</p>
